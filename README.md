<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Overview

The Cooperative Training Opportunities Website aims to streamline the search for cooperative training opportunities for university students. In the context of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Medical City, where there are three large hospitals within King Salman Health City, this platform simplifies the process. Instead of students having to individually visit each hospital to seek opportunities, they can select a hospital and apply directly through the system.

## Technologies Used

This project is built using a range of technologies and tools:

- **Java Persistence API (JPA)**: Used for managing entities and database relationships.
- **Jakarta Persistence**: Annotations like `@Entity` are used for entity mapping.
- **Lombok**: Employed to reduce boilerplate code and enhance code readability.
- **Database**: SQL Server Management Studio SSMS.

## System Design
- The website contains several pages:
- Home: It is the site's main page and contains a simplified overview of King Salman 
Medical City.
- Sign up: It is a new account registration page on the site. So, the student can apply.
- Log in: It is the page where the student can log in to the site with the previously registered 
account.
 -Training Registration: It is the collaborative training application registration page. Where 
the student fills out the application form and chooses the hospital where he wants to train.
- Registration Completed: It is the page that show the result after registration
